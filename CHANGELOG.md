# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.7.1] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- **Research hub, new section "Who else is building it" (12).** Three things that sit beside the stablecoin market and are routinely described as though they were inside it, each reported at the level it actually exists on.
  - **Arc: MAINNET LIVE, verified at chain level.** Circle's own release dates it 2026-09-16 in New York. Confirmed independently by probing the RPC endpoint, which answered `eth_chainId` with `0x13b2` (5042) and returned an advancing block height. A live testnet also exists (chain ID 5042002), and Arc's own "Connect to Arc" docs page serves the testnet tab by default, which is why some coverage calls Arc testnet-only. Both are live.
  - **Open USD: announced, not issued.** Announced 2026-06-30 with "over 140 businesses" named on the consortium's own site. CoinGecko reports a circulating supply of 0.0 and a null market cap, and the token is absent from DefiLlama's 427 tracked pegged assets. Caught while verifying: DefiLlama does carry a ticker "OUSD", but it is Origin Dollar, an unrelated project, so the absence check must name the clash or it reads as a contradiction. No primary source names a launch chain, so the chain set is reported UNKNOWN rather than copied from secondary coverage that contradicts itself.
  - **The funds beside the stablecoins.** Ondo USDY $2.29B and OUSG $319.8M, both read from Ondo's own product pages on 2026-09-26, and BUIDL reported as a range ($2.70-3.52B) because three sources disagree and no issuer-published current AUM exists. Corrects earlier reporting: OUSG's largest sleeve is State Street Galaxy SWEEP at roughly 45%, with BUIDL at roughly 30%.
- **Research hub, honest-growth counterweight (in section 12).** The forecast chart in section 2 points up; this measures the same market backwards from one aggregator series. Issuance growth computed from DefiLlama at year-end marks: +58.4% (2024), +49.0% (2025), +1.5% (2026 to date), now 3.05% below the 2026-05-20 peak. Real payments are about 1.2% of raw on-chain volume. Computed in this session, not carried forward.

### Notes
- Every new figure was verified at the parent against the primary source before it was written in, including re-deriving the growth percentages from the aggregator series and probing the Arc RPC endpoint directly rather than trusting the research pass that surfaced them.
- The new sources use deep URLs fetched and confirmed reachable (all HTTP 200), not landing pages written from memory.
- `scripts/verify-hub-depth.mjs` extended to guard the new data: Arc must read mainnet-live with both chain IDs, Open USD must read announced-only with the ticker clash named, BUIDL's size must stay a disagreeing range, and the 2026 stall figure must be present.
- noscript fallbacks added for both new blocks, per the hub's contract that every section renders as real HTML without JS.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- **Research hub, new section "Who earns the float".** Issuer economics from primary filings rather than press coverage. The load-bearing finding: Tether's Q2 2026 news release headlines a positive "$1.5B net operating profit" while its own attestation, for the same period, reports a change in net equity of minus $3,171 million for H1 and plus $1,040 million for Q1, which makes Q2 standalone about minus $4.21 billion. Both figures are Tether's; no Tether document reconciles them or defines "net operating profit". Circle's case is separately stated: $2.64B of FY2025 reserve income (96.0% of revenue) against a net loss of $69.5 million. Every row carries its own as-of date and states what it measures, because Tether publishes no line called "reserve income" and Circle does: the two are not a like-for-like pair.
- **Research hub, new section "The agent economy".** The GENIUS Act yield prohibition quoted from the statute (Sec. 4(a)(11), 12 U.S.C. 5903(a)(11)), with the note that a whole-Act keyword sweep finds "yield" exactly once and zero hits for reward, incentive, loyalty or dividend, so rewards programmes are reported as UNKNOWN rather than inferred. Seven agentic rails (x402, MPP, ACP, AP2, Visa TAP, Mastercard Agent Pay, ERC-8004) tabulated by layer and status, keeping a live settlement rail distinct from a live authorization layer. Every published volume figure for the same activity is shown side by side with its publisher and window, because they range from $25,000 to $2.59bn and are different quantities, not one quantity measured differently. Per-transaction medians (about one cent) are shown as the measure the totals hide.

### Fixed
- **Hub build badge could drift from the app version.** `HUB_BUILD` was a hand-written literal in `research/data.js` and had fallen two releases behind (`3.6.2` while the app was `3.6.3`), so the footer badge named a build that was not deployed. It is now derived from `package.json` at build time via `__HUB_BUILD__` in `vite.config.research.mjs`, which folds to a constant in the built bundle, so it cannot drift again.
- **Two hub token figures corrected against primary sources.** OUSG market cap was `~$700M` (mid-2026) and is `~$319-334M` as of 2026-09-17 per Ondo's own product page; BUIDL was `~$2-2.8B` and is `~$2.7-3.5B`. Both carried a `mid-2026` as-of that no longer held.

### Tests
- Test count 203, unchanged (no pure-logic module changed). Added `scripts/verify-hub-depth.mjs`, which runs the same data mapping the browser renderers use and asserts every new row is complete, that Tether's negative figure stays signed negative, that ERC-8004 is not presented as a payment layer, that the volume table names more than one publisher, and that no em or en dash entered the new content.

## [3.6.3] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed
- **Stale-data warning on launch was produced by the client, not the backend.** `cachedRequest` served a stale-while-revalidate copy of `/api/market` with no upper age limit, while `/api/healthz` is fetched live and never cached. On a cold launch with an old cached payload the two clocks came from different days and the dashboard printed a live "Historical snapshot updated 11m ago" beside a much older "Market data observed ..." and fired "Do not treat them as one clock". Both figures were individually true; pairing them was not. `/api/market` now refetches past `MAX_MARKET_STALE_MS` (2h, twelve times the 10-minute fetch cron cadence) instead of rendering a payload that is no longer a live view. The fallback-on-network-error behaviour is unchanged, and the other cached callers (coin chart, tickers) keep plain stale-while-revalidate.
- **The fetch job could die mid-run on a duplicate timestamp.** `market_snapshots.ts` is the PRIMARY KEY and is taken from the newest Helix point, which repeats whenever a cron tick lands before Helix advances. The plain `INSERT` then threw `UNIQUE constraint failed: market_snapshots.ts` and killed the whole run after prices had already been written, marking `jobs.fetch` failed. Reproduced on the VPS by running `fetch.js` twice back to back; the second run failed. Both write branches now upsert on `ts`, so a repeat tick updates instead of crashing.

### Tests
- Test count 198 to 203. Added `maxStale` cases for the cache policy (refetch when older than the limit, still serve within it) and `backend/jobs/lib/marketSnapshotUpsert.test.js`, which asserts the upsert is idempotent and also that the previous plain `INSERT` genuinely threw, so the guard is not theoretical.

## [3.6.2] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed
- **Backend market-flow direction:** `marketBackend.js` built chain observations as `[current, previous]` while `chainObservation` reads the last two entries as previous-then-current, so every mint/burn flow was inverted. Tokens are now emitted in ascending time order.
- **Chart re-creation on every render:** `ChartWrapper`'s `areOptionsEqual` returned `false` even when the options were equal, so every parent render destroyed and rebuilt its Chart.js instance.
- **Missing data no longer reads as healthy:** `bps()` returns `null` on invalid input instead of `0`, so an absent price can never render as on-peg drift. `computePegStress` filters nulls rather than counting them as zero stress; `generateAlerts` skips them; the Home and Coin price maps use nullish coalescing instead of `|| 1`, so an outage shows a hyphen rather than a false `$1`.
- **Alert id collision:** `alertEventId` now hashes the directed `from>to` pair as well as the sorted chain set, so opposite migrations in the same window no longer share one id. Stored ids churn once on the next stress run.
- **Aggregate zeroing:** `buildMarketSnapshot` sums the deltas it has instead of voiding the whole market delta when one coin lacks a 24h-ago point.
- **Chain casing:** chains are lowercased at write (fetch), at group time (market view, stress), and at read (the `/api/history` chain filter), so `Tron` and `tron` can no longer double-count the same rail.
- **Whale Watch share:** share is measured against total tracked absolute flow rather than only the surfaced rows, so a small flagged move can no longer display as a large share of itself.
- **Hub captions recomputed from the chart's own data:** the taxonomy caption now states 14% using midpoints (up to about 17% using high ends), and the chart itself parses range midpoints so the bars and the caption agree. The taxonomy canvas `aria-label` was corrected from a stale "around 84%" to 86% on the same midpoint basis.
- **Hub freshness badge:** the footer date was hand-written (2026-08-12) and had drifted from the dataset's real as-of date. It is now rendered from `data.AS_OF` and `data.HUB_BUILD`, with a static fallback in the HTML.
- **Taxonomy no-JS fallback:** the `noscript` block still carried a `$299-316B` figure contradicting the taxonomy data; it now matches.
- **Share-card scope:** every coin-tab share card now states its range, interpretation, as-of, and that figures cover tracked coins only, not global market supply. Share timestamps render in UTC so exports match `formatUtc` provenance.

### Changed
- **About copy:** removed drift-prone hard supply numbers and corrected the data-sources description, which still claimed both feeds were fetched directly from the browser.
- **Sidebar freshness wording:** "Data current" changed to "Last sync", so the label no longer overstates freshness when the backend snapshot is old.
- **`buildSupplyHistory`** takes an injectable `nowMs` so the day-window test is not time-bombed.

### Tests
- Test count 150 to 198 across both the dashboard and backend suites.

### Docs
- Version bumped across `package.json`, `backend/package.json`, both lockfiles (which had been left at 3.4.0), the `APP_VERSION` fallback, the README badge, and the hub build marker.

## [3.6.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **Slashless `/research`:** the SPA HTML now redirects `/research` to `/research/` so a shared link does not fall through to the dashboard when origin nginx has not picked up the 301 yet.
- **Migration context:** Whale Watch and Mint/Burn label matched opposite legs as one Polygon → Ethereum style movement instead of two independent risks.
- **Mobile Signal Card:** the sheet opens at the title/close row, keeps Download reachable, hides bottom nav while open, and collapses the large preview behind "Preview card".
- **Mobile supply chart:** phones default to the two largest series with a Compare all control and fewer x-axis ticks.

### Added
- Backend `job_runs` table and `/api/healthz.jobs` so a deployed fetch/stress/ai cycle is observable (run id, finish time, last error, source timestamp).

### Docs
- Backend README lists the origin nginx + cron steps the deployer must run after this release. Local agent notes stay unpublished.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **Truthful freshness:** the dashboard no longer treats browser `Date.now()` as market time. The strip shows Checked (this fetch), Market observed (upstream snapshot), and Historical snapshot (SQLite), with Current / Delayed / Stale / Unavailable state. A missing optional backend snapshot does not mark a successful live fetch as Unavailable; DefiLlama's daily supply age (for example 8h) is on cadence, not a failed check.
- **Alert event time:** alerts use source observation timestamps and a stable event fingerprint. Reloading does not mint a new "2m ago" event.
- **DAI-style opposing flows:** matched chain deltas within 10% become one `MIGRATION` event (gross + net) and the paired child flow cards are suppressed from the primary feed.
- **Interval wording:** "in the last 24h" is used only when the two snapshots are 20-28 hours apart; otherwise the copy names the actual gap and confidence drops.
- **Mobile Home:** metric chips under Peg Stability Index and chart grids stack full width at phone widths (Icewater desktop rules no longer override the mobile stack). Chart canvases are 280-340px tall.
- **`/research` deep link:** nginx exact `location = /research` 301s to `/research/` before SPA fallback.

### Added
- Canonical `alert_events` SQLite table and `GET /api/alerts` lifecycle feed (open / resolved). Current Alerts and Learn history share the same event IDs.
- Signal Card share stays outside the canvas (toolbar / mobile bottom sheet) with Story, Square, and Landscape export.

### Changed
- Alert rules: `CHAIN_FLOW`, `MIGRATION`, `NET_MINT`, `NET_BURN` (legacy CHAIN_SPIKE / MEGA_SUPPLY explanations still apply). Filters by severity and coin are unchanged.

### Docs
- Public docs (README, architecture, API protocol, data sources, scaling, backend README, SECURITY, issue templates) aligned to three-clock freshness, canonical `alert_events`, `/research` redirect, and source-available (not OSI) licensing. Local agent notes stay unpublished.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Mobile Market Pulse:** hero stacks vertically with full-width stability gauge and 2-column peg chips (no clipped two-column desktop layout).
- **Mobile charts:** supply/peg and other dashboard grids force single column with `min-width: 0`, ~260px chart height, and no page-level horizontal overflow.
- **Signal Card sheet:** true mobile bottom sheet with focus trap, Escape/backdrop close, body scroll lock, and **Download Signal Card** primary action.
- **Share control:** moved out of the canvas/legend into a labeled Share toolbar (desktop + mobile).

### Changed
- **Mobile nav:** Dashboard · Assets · Research · Alerts · More (Assets opens picker; More opens instrument rail; selected asset stays labeled).
- **First-run tour:** compact banner under Market Pulse with Skip (no full-screen dimmer).
- **Chains:** learner takeaway plus per-coin Top-5 chain cards (absolute multi-coin bar chart removed from this view).
- **Research matrix:** stacked comparison cards on phones; desktop matrix retained.
- **Alerts empty state:** "No material stress detected in this refresh" with four rule cards; filters muted when zero events.
- **P2 polish:** Research Hub canonical line, desktop Share label, darker-theme helper text contrast.

### Docs
- README and architecture docs aligned to the five-item mobile nav, stacked Market Pulse/charts, Share toolbar, and Signal Card sheet.
- Changelog wording scrubbed of unpublished local tooling paths; packaging described as source-available (not open-source).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Icewater Instrument shell:** fixed instrument rail, utility topbar, Glacier Blue accent tokens, Manrope + DM Serif Display, light page background (`--page-bg: #F7F5F2`).
- **In-app Research tab** with shelf links to `/research/` and an interactive depeg case study. Case data is imported from `research/data.js` (no duplicated article facts).
- **Brand assets:** SVG brand mark in chrome, optimized PNG wordmark, Signal Lens / learn-orb / case-study art on hero and Research surfaces only.
- **Signal Cards:** share sheet formats (Story / Square / Landscape) via ChartWrapper + ShareSheet.
- **Asset page hierarchy** for coin tabs (hero, metrics, peg, score, supply, chains, learn CTA).

### Changed
- **Mobile:** bottom nav preserved; hamburger opens the instrument rail as a drawer.
- **Research hub depeg section** rewritten as mechanism selector / flow / matrix / takeaways (still canonical full hub at `/research/`).
- **Coin colors** remapped to Icewater blues / violet / amber / coral (no finance green).
- **Decorative washes softened:** learn orb opacity 0.05, lighter hero art, guide lines use `--blue-line`.
- Stability gauge displays `100 - stress.score` while stress math in `derive.js` stays unchanged.

### Docs
- Public docs updated for dual Research surfaces and the Icewater shell. Unpublished local tooling notes are excluded from the repository.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Pass 1 - Data honesty

#### Fixed
- **Remittance calculator rebuilt as author's model:** the old `4.65% + $245 fixed` formula printed ~$46,745 at $1,000,000 (a retail remittance percentage applied to a wholesale ticket with a fake fixed SWIFT fee). Replaced with named assumption schedules (RPW-like retail at $200/$500 only, SME wire 2% + $40, commercial 25 bp + $25), stacked rows for every lever (wire fee, FX markup, float, on-ramp, gas, off-ramp), float as its own line, a 6-row sourced scenario table, and a "full cash-to-cash" preset. Default amount changed to $200 (the World Bank RPW measurement point). RPW-like schedule warns above $500. Learn lesson, hub thesis, and race bar rewritten in lockstep to tell one story. Kills the $46,745-at-$1M and $710-at-$10k bugs.
- **z-score display cap:** uncapped z-scores (e.g. 1693.8sigma for a $2M move on a quiet chain) now display as `>10sigma` with the raw value in a tooltip. Added a "Share of tracked" percentage column to contextualize small-chain spikes against total flow.
- **$1 peg line + shared band:** Home Peg Monitor and coin-tab price chart now both show a dashed $1 reference line and share the same `pegBand` helper so they cannot drift apart. The coin tab previously had neither band nor line.
- **Chain Rankings sort + relabel:** table was unsorted vendor order (Manta #1 at $6M, Tron #7 at $92B). Now sorts descending by stablecoin circulating supply. Header relabeled from "Total TVL" to "Stablecoin Circulating" (the field is `totalCirculatingUSD.peggedUSD`, not TVL). Added name search with stable rank numbers. Migration Detector relabeled "(approximate)" since DefiLlama gives per-chain deltas, not directed hops.
- **Exchange-ticker dedupe:** CoinGecko feed listed BTCC twice. New `dedupeTickers` helper deduplicates by `market.identifier` and suffixes name collisions ("BTCC", "BTCC (2)").
- **Supply chart humanized ticks:** y-axis no longer renders `80,000,000,000`; uses `fmtB` ($80B). Added Log and "% from start" toggles on Home and coin supply charts. Registered `LogarithmicScale` in ChartWrapper.
- **Taxonomy aria-label:** said "Fiat-USD dominates at over 95%" while the caption said 15-16% other. Re-derived from the chart's own data (83.8% fiat-USD); aria-label now says "around 84%", consistent with the caption.

### Pass 2 - Teachable metrics

#### Added
- **Dominance chart** on the coin tab using the previously-ready-but-uncharted `buildShareSeries` helper. Shows the coin's share of tracked stablecoin supply over time with a percent axis.
- **Peg deviation in bps chart** on the coin tab. Fixed -50/+50 bps bounds prevent the auto-band exaggeration the price chart still suffers from. Dashed 0 bps reference line.
- **Mint/burn color legend** in CapitalFlows. A one-line coin-color key above the bars explains which color is which coin; per-segment `title` tooltips show the per-coin delta.
- **Empty-state alert primer:** new `AlertPrimer.jsx` replaces the bare "No active alerts." with a one-paragraph explanation of the four alert rules (PEG_BREAK, CHAIN_SPIKE, MEGA_SUPPLY, DOM_SHIFT). Wired into SignalSummary (compact) and AlertsTab (full, zero-alerts case).

### Pass 3 - Research hub editorial

#### Added
- **Yield-bearing stablecoin debate** (extends Banks section): four cited callouts (CRS IF13173/IF13174, State Street Apr 2026, BPI citing Cong/Chiu, Federal Reserve Dec 2025) covering the GENIUS Act yield prohibition and the contested macro-stability implications.
- **BPI full-journey callout** next to the remittance calculator: the Bank Policy Institute Jul 2026 finding that stablecoins showed no systematic cost advantage (0.3-9% across ten corridors; on/off-ramp FX dominated; speed followed the local rail).
- **T-bill maturity-band visual** (extends Treasury section): reserve composition by maturity for Tether and Circle from their Q1 2026 attestations. Teaches why issuers prefer short-term bills (redemption liquidity) and the Yadav/Malone interdependence point.
- **GENIUS Act rulemaking status** (extends Regulation section): a dated paragraph (not a live tracker, no review-cadence promise) summarizing status as of Aug 2026: 26 rulemakings across 6 agencies, 10 NPRMs issued, 0 final rules, full implementation Jan 18, 2027.

### Pass 4 - Insight engine (backend lock lifted)

#### Added
- **`stress_series` + `labels` SQLite tables** (`backend/lib/db.js`): INTEGER ts, WITHOUT ROWID, composite primary keys, matching the existing `snapshots` convention. Indexes on `(symbol, ts)`.
- **`backend/jobs/stress.js`:** a third cron job that reads the latest snapshots, reuses `computePegStress` and `generateAlerts` from derive.js, and writes per-coin stress index, z-score, raw delta, and normalized delta to `stress_series`, plus active alerts to `labels`. Runs every 10 minutes after fetch with a 60s sleep. Verified end-to-end against seed data.
- **`ai.js` prompt rewrite:** SYSTEM_PROMPT now asks the model to answer "why is this interesting" and "how was this computed" in student-explainable language. `buildContext` extended to read from the new `stress_series` and `labels` tables. Kept JSON-only, cadence self-gate, and fallback model. No second narrative job.
- **`/api/labels` and `/api/stress` endpoints** (`backend/server.js`): expose stored alert history and stress series so the Learn tab can read accumulated events.
- **Learn case-studies lesson:** new "Case studies: when the signal was real" lesson covering UST/Terra May 2022 and USR March 2026. USR is explicitly framed as "key compromise / unbacked mint" (an exploit), not "our index called it" (a pre-depeg signal), per synthesis section 6.6.

### Tests
- 18 new tests for the pure helpers (`pegBand`, `pegRefLine`, `pegChartOptions`, `toPercentFromFirst`, `dedupeTickers`, z-score cap, share-of-tracked). 124 total, all green.
- Backend stress job verified manually end-to-end (5 stress_series rows + 3 labels rows against seed data); no backend test harness added per the "tests target pure modules only" convention.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **USDE supply bug:** root cause was a case-sensitivity collision in `assembleLlama` - DefiLlama returns two assets with symbol "USDe" (id=146, Ethena, ~$3.95B) and "USDE" (id=264, XBANKING, ~$49K). The old case-sensitive `Set.has()` matched the XBANKING imposter. Fixed with case-insensitive match + id-priority disambiguation. Also added `dataQuality` flag, amber warning chip on StatCard, and SignalHero exclusion note.
- **Hub remittance calculator:** old formula (0.1% + $8 fixed) gave $8.05 at $50 (16%, worse than banks) and $18 at $10k (contradicted "under $10" headline). Rewritten to `networkFeeUsd: 0.10` + optional off-ramp spread checkbox; both rails shown simultaneously.
- **Hub hero $0 flicker:** fetch race could render $0. Guarded with "Loading..." initial state + partial-fetch annotation.
- **Hub forecast chart:** `parseFloat(range.replace(/[^0-9.]/g, ''))` mangled range strings. Rewritten as floating-bar bands with explicit `low`/`high` numeric fields + visual padding for narrow bands.
- **Dashboard peg chart:** auto-scaled 0-1.0, flattening peg drift. Now uses dynamic band around the series clamped to +/-2% of $1.
- **Hub depeg cards:** per-card min/max scaling made all three cards look identical. Now uses shared Y domain $0.00-$1.05, $1.00 reference line, 25 points, low-point labels, failure-mode captions.
- **Chains chart label overlap + 979px table:** added `maxRotation: 45, autoSkip: true`; mobile card-row layout already existed.
- **Dark-mode gridlines:** added `--grid-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.18)`.
- **SettingsPanel focus trap:** Tab now wraps within dialog; focus restored to settings button on close.
- **Hub Section 6 undefined buttons:** data shape mismatch fixed.

### Added

- Coin-tab anomalies section (Whale Watch per coin).
- Sidebar per-coin alert badges.
- Stat card 24h change chips.
- Outlined skeleton placeholders (replaced solid gray blocks).
- First-run tour (3 steps, localStorage-gated, dismissible).
- Chart zoom/pan (chartjs-plugin-zoom) on 90-day line charts + dbl-click reset.
- Share-as-screenshot on every chart card (Story/Square/Landscape, offscreen canvas composite, brand footer, no new deps beyond zoom plugin).
- Hub sticky reading progress bar + section-highlight TOC.
- Hub dark mode toggle.
- Hub CSV export for token comparison table.
- Mobile nav icons (SVG per tab type).
- `dataQuality` warning system for failed upstream fetches.
- Coin-config alias support (`llamaStablecoinAliases`).

### Changed

- Mobile chart sizing: dashboard `aspect-ratio: 16/7` in grid-2 under 768px; research `aspect-ratio: 16/8` on mobile.
- Coin-tab by-chain table: filters out $0 chains, sorts by supply, shows top-10.
- Share-as-screenshot uses direct `ctx.drawImage(chartCanvas)` instead of `toBase64Image()` roundtrip.

## [3.2.5] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Research hub: "State of Stablecoins" at `/research/` - a public, fully-cited, chart-driven report on the stablecoin landscape and economic impact. Nine sections (taxonomy, scale, Treasury holdings, banks vs. stablecoins, cross-border payments, dollarization, depeg history, regulation, reality check) plus a live hero counter, remittance calculator, and deduplicated source list. Built as a separate static page (second Vite config) for SEO, not a Preact route.
- Hub cross-links from Learn's intro card, the bottom of the "Beyond the dollar" and "The bigger picture" modules, and the About tab. No nav slot added (mobile nav already at 10 items).
- Hub OG share image (`og.png`, 1200x630) with the engraved-ledger design - no headline number, per the numeric-claim-precision rule.
- Numeric-claim-precision standing rule: every prominent single-number display must state what it measures and excludes in the visible label.
- Hub build pipeline: `npm run build:research` (uses `vite.config.research.mjs`) and `npm run build:all`. nginx `/research/` location block added to `backend/deploy/nginx.conf`.
- App-wide meta tags strengthened in `index.html` (broader description mentioning the value-referenced-token definition, canonical URL, `og:url`, Twitter large-image card).

### Verified

- Four highest-stakes claims resolved against primary sources on 2026-08-12: Treasury-holder ranking (US Treasury TIC Jan 2023), GENIUS Act effective-date mechanics (Morgan Lewis + Congress.gov S.1582), SVB/USDC low ($0.8789 per CoinGecko Research), UST collapse figure (~$18B supply peak, ~$60B combined UST+LUNA loss per CoinMarketCap/Reuters/ScienceDirect). Resolutions and primary-source links live in the hub's methodology note.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Learn tab v3: two new modules ("Beyond the dollar", "The bigger picture") with 10 new lessons covering the value-referenced-token taxonomy (gold-backed, crypto-collateralized, synthetic, algorithmic, tokenized funds) and the macroeconomic impact (Treasury demand, bank disintermediation, cross-border payments, trust breaks, the global regulatory landscape).
- Per-lesson `lastUpdated` date field on fast-decaying content; rendered next to the lesson title. The five "bigger picture" lessons carry `2026-08-12`.
- Three new glossary terms: Reference asset, Tokenized fund, Funding rate.

### Changed

- Learn tab intro rewritten from the dollar-only frame ("a stablecoin should stay close to $1.00") to the broader value-referenced-token definition (stable relative to a reference, usually but not always USD). Tracked coins on the dashboard remain USD-pegged by design.
- First-time visitors now land in compact mode by default; an explicit prior choice in localStorage is still respected.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Learn tab v2: 16 lessons across 4 collapsible modules (Fundamentals, The ecosystem map, Risk & history, Regulation & outlook) plus an expanded 20-term glossary.
- Deterministic live observations (`src/lib/insights.js`): data-grounded callouts rendered inline under lessons (dominance, peg drift, chain concentration, collateral mix, alert count). Computed locally from dashboard data, no AI, no network, reproducible from the stat cards.
- Cross-links into Learn: a "What does this mean?" affordance under the Home peg-stress index, and per-rule "Learn" links inside alert cards that deep-link to the matching lesson.
- One-time localStorage migration from legacy `stablepulse:*` keys to `stablesense:*` (theme, refresh, compact) with automatic cleanup of the old cache prefix.

### Changed

- **Brand rename to StableSense** across UI, metadata, config keys, localStorage keys, package names, backend artifacts, and docs.
- Config keys renamed: `window.STABLEPULSE_CONFIG` to `window.STABLESENSE_CONFIG`, `STABLEPULSE_AI_API_BASE` to `STABLESENSE_AI_API_BASE`.
- Mobile bottom nav now scrolls horizontally so the added Learn tab keeps 44px touch targets at 375px.
- Backend artifacts renamed end-to-end: `stablesense.db`, `stablesense-backend.service`, `/opt/stablesense`, `/var/log/stablesense`; see `backend/README.md` for the VPS migration steps.
- Version aligned to 3.1.0 in `package.json` and in the `config.js` fallback string.

### Removed

- Nothing.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Top-5 stablecoin coverage: USDT, USDC, DAI, USDe and PYUSD (registry-driven, one config entry per coin).
- Browser-direct data layer (`src/lib/api.js`): fetches DefiLlama + CoinGecko straight from the visitor's browser with SWR caching, 60s throttle, 1h cache-first detail, 20s timeout, and stale-on-error fallback.
- Lite VPS backend (`backend/`): Fastify + SQLite (WAL) history accumulation, cron jobs (`jobs/fetch.js` every 10 min, `jobs/ai.js` gated on `AI_CADENCE_MIN`), endpoints `/api/healthz`, `/api/ai`, `/api/history`.
- Deterministic client-side alert engine (`generateAlerts` in `derive.js`): PEG_BREAK, CHAIN_SPIKE, MEGA_SUPPLY, DOM_SHIFT with per-coin thresholds; explanations rendered locally (no per-alert AI round-trip).
- AI narrative ticker showing last-updated / next-update times from the backend.

### Changed

- Dropped the Cloudflare Worker `/api/dashboard` aggregator; the frontend no longer depends on a single pre-aggregated JSON payload.
- Runtime config key renamed from `apiBase` to `aiApiBase` (build-time `STABLEPULSE_AI_API_BASE`).
- Market-cap total now summed from all registered coins (DefiLlama no longer reports a global aggregate).
- README/docs updated for the hybrid topology; scaling guide rewritten for the VPS backend.

### Fixed

- `totalMarketCap` was `undefined` under the new data layer; now computed by summing `peggedUSD` across `peggedAssets`.
- `megaSupplyUsd` thresholds for DAI, USDE, PYUSD were set above those coins' whole supply; corrected to sane relative values so MEGA_SUPPLY can fire.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Brand rename to **StablePulse** across UI, metadata, config keys, and docs.
- Config-driven stablecoin registry (`src/utils/coin-config.js`); adding a coin is a config-only change.
- Real auto-refresh with selectable interval and a manual **Refresh now** button.
- Background refreshes keep last-known data on screen with a "Refreshing" state (no blanking).
- Graceful degradation: errors keep last-good data with a banner; skeleton only on first load.
- Stale-while-revalidate behavior with a 20s fetch timeout and abort on unmount.
- Lazy-loaded Chart.js (Line/Bar only) so charts load on demand.
- Memoized derive and chart series computation to avoid per-second re-render cost.
- Content-visibility hints for below-fold sections.
- AI narrative and per-alert explanations rendered from whatever the worker returns (provider-agnostic).
- Theme settings: Light default, with Dark and System options.
- Security policy (`SECURITY.md`), architecture/API/scaling docs, CI workflow, and issue templates.
- Source-available license, README, changelog, and release packaging (`license`, `engines`, npm test script).

### Fixed

- "Supply History" chart was flat; now shows real history.
- `buildShareSeries` date-bucket bug (caught by new unit tests).
- Formatter placeholders consistently render a single hyphen for null/unknown values.
- Header height on notched/landscape phones: now accounts for the safe-area inset.
- Tap-highlight on mobile buttons; text-size adjustment for iOS.
- Whale-watch table overflow guard; Tron/Eth compare stacks on very small screens.

### Changed

- Default theme is Light (previously followed the OS via System).
- localStorage keys namespaced to `stablepulse:*`.
- Runtime config global renamed to `window.STABLEPULSE_CONFIG`; build-time env to `STABLEPULSE_API_BASE`.
- Unified theme handling in a single hook and a pre-paint bootstrap script.
