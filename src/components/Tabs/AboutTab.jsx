            Beyond the live dashboard, StableSense publishes a long-form, fully-cited research report:
            <strong> The State of Stablecoins</strong>. It covers the wider value-referenced-token
            taxonomy (gold-backed, crypto-collateralized, synthetic, algorithmic, tokenized funds),
            the macroeconomic impact (Treasury-market effects, bank disintermediation, cross-border
            payments, dollarization, systemic risk), depeg history, and the global regulatory
            landscape, with charts and a sourced citation list. Every figure is dated and ranges are
            shown where sources disagree.
